# rpi-setup
This repo collects a few scripts useful for setting up a Raspberry Pi 
with some useful components. 

I hate repeating the same things again with every new Raspberry Pi added 
to my network, so here we have some automation.

## Contents

- echo.sh: just a "hello world"to see the scripts are being executed.
- ping.sh: fix the permissions on the ping command toallow
all users to use the ping command. See description [on my
blog](http://blog.abarbanell.de/linux/2017/01/11/ping/).
- node.sh: TODO - install up to date node version, this will take time
as it will have to built node from sources.
- vscode.sh: TODO - install Visual Studio Code (requires node)
